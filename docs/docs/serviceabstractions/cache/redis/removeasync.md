# RemoveAsync Method

The `RemoveAsync` method is part of the `IRedisRepository<T>` interface in the `NetPlus.ServiceAbstractions.Cache.Redis` library. This method removes an object from the Redis cache asynchronously based on the specified key.

## Syntax

```csharp
public async Task<bool> RemoveAsync(string key)
```

## Parameters

- `key`: The unique identifier for the object in the Redis cache. This is a string.

## Returns

A task representing the asynchronous operation and containing a boolean indicating if the object was successfully removed.

## Example

```csharp
var repository = serviceProvider.GetService<IRedisRepository<MyClass>>();
bool success = await repository.RemoveAsync("myKey");
```

In this example, the object with the key "myKey" will be removed from the Redis cache. The `success` variable will be `true` if the object was successfully removed, and `false` otherwise.

## Remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The `RemoveAsync` method uses the `KeyDeleteAsync` method from the `IDatabase` interface provided by the StackExchange.Redis library to remove the value from Redis.

> [!TIP]
> If the key does not exist in the Redis cache, the `RemoveAsync` method will return `false`.

> [!WARNING]
> Be aware that the `RemoveAsync` method will throw an exception if the Redis server is not available or if there is a network issue. Make sure to handle these exceptions in your code.
