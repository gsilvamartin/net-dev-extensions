## InsertAsync Method

### Summary

The `InsertAsync` method is used to insert a new entity into the MongoDB collection asynchronously.

### Parameters

- `entity`: The entity to insert. This should be an instance of a class that inherits from `BaseEntity` and has the `BsonCollectionAttribute`.

### Returns

This method returns a `Task` representing the asynchronous operation. The result of the task is `void`.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the `InsertAsync` method:

```csharp
var myEntity = new MyEntity
{
    // Initialize properties
};

await _repository.InsertAsync(myEntity);
```

In this example, `MyEntity` is a class that inherits from `BaseEntity` and has the `BsonCollectionAttribute`. The `_repository` is an instance of `IMongoRepository<MyEntity>`.

### Remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The `InsertAsync` method uses the MongoDB driver's `InsertOneAsync` method to insert the entity into the MongoDB collection.

> [!warning]
> If an error occurs during the insertion, the method throws an exception.
