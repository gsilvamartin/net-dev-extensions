## GetAllAsync Method

### Summary

The `GetAllAsync` method is used to retrieve all entities from the MongoDB collection asynchronously.

### Parameters

This method does not take any parameters.

### Returns

This method returns a `Task<IEnumerable<T>>` representing the asynchronous operation. The result of the task is an `IEnumerable<T>` that contains all entities in the MongoDB collection.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the `GetAllAsync` method:

```csharp
var allEntities = await _repository.GetAllAsync();
```

In this example, `allEntities` will be an `IEnumerable<MyEntity>` that contains all entities in the MongoDB collection. The `_repository` is an instance of `IMongoRepository<MyEntity>`.

### Remarks

> [!NOTE]
> The `GetAllAsync` method uses the MongoDB driver's `Find` and `ToListAsync` methods to retrieve all entities from the MongoDB collection.

> [!warning]
> If an error occurs during the retrieval, the method throws an exception.
