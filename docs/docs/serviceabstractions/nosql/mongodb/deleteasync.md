## DeleteAsync Method

### Summary

The `DeleteAsync` method is used to delete an existing entity from the MongoDB collection asynchronously.

### Parameters

- `id`: The identifier of the entity to delete. This should be a string representing the ObjectId of the entity in the MongoDB collection.

### Returns

This method returns a `Task` representing the asynchronous operation. The result of the task is `void`.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the `DeleteAsync` method:

```csharp
await _repository.DeleteAsync("60d5f3b8c9e4a6218c34d5a7");
```

In this example, the `_repository` is an instance of `IMongoRepository<MyEntity>`.

### Remarks

> [!info]
> The `DeleteAsync` method uses the MongoDB driver's `DeleteOneAsync` method to delete the entity from the MongoDB collection. The method constructs a filter using the provided `id` and the MongoDB driver's `Filter.Eq` method.

> [!warning]
> If an error occurs during the deletion, the method throws an exception.
