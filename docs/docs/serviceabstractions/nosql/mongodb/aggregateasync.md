## AggregateAsync Method

### Summary

This method performs an aggregation pipeline operation on the MongoDB collection and returns the resulting entities.

### Parameters

- `pipeline`: A `PipelineDefinition<T, TResult>` that defines the aggregation pipeline operation to perform.

### Returns

This method returns a `Task<IEnumerable<TResult>>` representing the asynchronous operation. The result of the task is an `IEnumerable<TResult>` of the resulting entities.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use this method:

```csharp
var pipeline = Builders<MyEntity>.Pipeline.Project<MyResult>(Builders<MyEntity>.Projection.Expression(x => new MyResult { Property = x.Property }));
var results = await _repository.AggregateAsync(pipeline);
```

In this example, `results` will be an `IEnumerable<MyResult>` of the resulting entities from the MongoDB collection where each `MyResult` has `Property` set to the `Property` of the corresponding `MyEntity`.

### Remarks

This method uses the MongoDB driver's `Aggregate` and `ToListAsync` methods to perform an aggregation pipeline operation on the MongoDB collection and get the resulting entities as a list.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `pipeline` parameter is `null`, the MongoDB driver will throw an `ArgumentNullException`.

> [!WARNING]
> If the aggregation pipeline operation does not match any entities in the MongoDB collection, the `Aggregate` method will return an empty list, and this method will return an empty `IEnumerable<TResult>`.
