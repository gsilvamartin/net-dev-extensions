## AggregateCountAsync Method

### Summary

This method performs an aggregation pipeline operation on the MongoDB collection and returns the count of the resulting entities.

### Parameters

- `pipeline`: A `PipelineDefinition<T, T>` that defines the aggregation pipeline operation to perform.

### Returns

This method returns a `Task<long>` representing the asynchronous operation. The result of the task is a `long` representing the count of the resulting entities.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use this method:

```csharp
var pipeline = Builders<MyEntity>.Pipeline.Match(x => x.Property == "value");
var count = await _repository.AggregateCountAsync(pipeline);
```

In this example, `count` will be the count of the entities in the MongoDB collection where `Property` equals `"value"`.

### Remarks

This method uses the MongoDB driver's `Aggregate` and `ToListAsync` methods to perform an aggregation pipeline operation on the MongoDB collection and get the resulting entities as a list.

> [!NOTE]
> If the `pipeline` parameter is `null`, the MongoDB driver will throw an `ArgumentNullException`.

> [!WARNING]
> If the aggregation pipeline operation does not match any entities in the MongoDB collection, the `Aggregate` method will return an empty list, and this method will return `0`.
